;;{{{ Interactive Check Implementation:

;;; Notes:

;; The implementation from 2014 worked for emacspeak.  it has been
;; moved to obsolete/old-emacspeak-preamble.el to avoid the fragility
;; from using backtrace-frame.  See
;; http://tvraman.github.io/emacspeak/blog/ems-interactive-p.html for
;; the version that depended on calling backtrace-frame.

;; This updated implementation avoids that call and was contributed
;; by Stefan Monnier in April 2022.
;; Note that like called-interactively-p, our predicate only returns T
;; for the top-level call, not for any further recursive calls of the
;; function.

;;; Design:
;; Advice on funcall-interactively stores the name of the
;; interactive command being run.
;; The defadvice macro is itself adviced to generate a locally bound
;; predicate that ensures that ems-interactive-p is only called from
;; within emacspeak advice forms.
;; Thus, ems-interactive-p is reserved for use within Emacspeak advice.

(defvar ems--interactive-fn-name nil
